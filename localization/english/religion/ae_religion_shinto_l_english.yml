 special_doctrine_teachings_of_buddha_desc:0 "Shinbutsu-shūgō means the Syncretism of Kami and Buddhas. Japanese Shinto and Buddhism were largely intertwined with each other from around 600CE, and many of their ideas at this point in time were considered to be one and the same. The two religions only had started to be considered more separate in the Meiji period (1860~) when an effort was organized to isolate the Shinto beliefs that were wholly thought of as Shinto."
