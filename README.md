then, extract the folder to your ck3 mods directory, the common, history, etc folders should be in a folder called Asia-Erweiterung-Extended-main.

Next, rename the folder Asia-Erweiterung-Extended-main to Asia-Erweiterung-Extended

it should look something like this documents/paradox interactive/crusader kings 3/mod/Asia-Erweiterung-Extended
