AEP: **Beta 0.7.1**
MP Checksum for 1.13.* (Basileus): **b05b**

***The Asia Expansion Project (AEP)*** is a mod that expands the world of *Crusader Kings III* by extending the game’s map to include the vast expanse of the Far East. From the rugged Manchurian frontier in the north to the western edges of Papua in the south, AEP offers players an expansive and immersive world to explore.

AEP's hallmark lies in its meticulous attention to detail and historical accuracy, faithfully depicting the realms, cultures, characters, and religions of the Far East. The mod also aims to introduce new events, decisions, and challenges, providing fresh and engaging gameplay that will greatly enhance your CKIII experience.

[**Available on Steam Workshop**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2970440958)

**Q: I'm experiencing issues with the mod. What should I do?** </br>
**A:** To troubleshoot the issue, please follow these steps:
 1. Ensure you have installed the latest version of the Asia Expansion Project (AEP) from either the project's Steam Workshop or GitHub page.
 2. Verify that the latest version of AEP is updated and compatible with the most recent update of Crusader Kings III.
 3. Launch Crusader Kings III with only AEP installed to eliminate potential conflicts with other mods.
If the issue persists, report it in the "# bugs-and-problems" channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PHuf3HE6). Please include screenshots and a detailed description of the problem to assist us in resolving the issue.

**Q: Oh the humanity! Why is everyone in Asia naked?** </br>
**A:** This issue is typically caused by a mod conflict or an incorrect load order, especially when using clothing mods such as the Community Flavor Pack (CFP) or Ethnicities & Portraits Expanded (EPE) alongside AEP. Fortunately, AEP offers compatibility patches for both mods, which can be found under the compatibility section.

In rare instances, the problem may arise from corrupted or missing game files in the Paradox root directory, necessitating a validation of those files. Please ensure these possibilities are addressed before reporting them in the "bugs-and-problems" channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/PHuf3HE6).

**Q: What’s the difference between AEP, RoA, and OE?** </br>
**A:**
 * Asia Expansion Project (AEP): AEP's focus lies primarily on East Asia while maintaining a style that is more consistent with the base game by only adding gameplay features that will blend well with those already present in CKIII.
 * Rajas of Asia (RoA): RoA's focus lies primarily on Southeast Asia while maintaining a style that is less consistent with the base game by adding certain gameplay features that certain players may find jarring when contrasted with the other regions of the map.
 * Oriental Empires (OE): OE's focus lies primarily on China, and much like RoA maintains a style that is less consistent with the base game. Furthermore, the mod lacks localization support as it was developed by an all-Chinese team, and thus is practically unplayable for anyone without an understanding of Mandarin.

**Q: Is there, or will there be, a compatibility patch for (insert mod)?** </br>
**A:** Currently, we only provide compatibility patches for the Community Flavor Pack (CFP) and Ethnicities & Portraits Expanded (EPE). As of now, we do not plan to extend support to other mods; however, you are welcome to create your own patches if you'd like, and we would be more than happy to add them to our compatibility list.

**Q: Are converters available for EU4 or other Paradox games?** </br>
**A:** Currently, we do not plan to create converters for EU4 or any other Paradox games. However, you are welcome to create your own, and we would be more than happy to mention it here.

**Q: Does this mod alter any core mechanics or add new ones to the base game?** </br>
**A:** Currently, AEP does not alter any core mechanics or add new ones to the base game. However, there are plans to introduce new government types, struggle mechanics, events, and decisions in future releases of the mod.

**Q: Are you collaborating or planning to collaborate with any other modders on the Workshop?** </br>
**A:** Yes, we are collaborating with some modders which we are sure to credit. We prefer to use our in-house assets but are open to utilizing assets created by others, provided their content aligns with the project's goals.

**Q: How can I stay updated on the mod or report bugs I discover?** </br>
**A:** To stay updated on changes, report any bugs, or reach out for assistance, you are welcome to join the [AEP Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PHuf3HE6).
